    "### Some Notes About Radical Implementation\n",
    "The function returns a modified structure ref. The structure is first passes as a variable and then the solution and analysis is appended then the structure is returned with these new attributes. This opens an interesting question, is a calibration a stateless function or a class? The RadicalData.mat is a serialization of a class, but SRAlgorithmV3 is a stated function (really a method ) on the Ref object. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, I think the series resistor experiment (analysis) is a class and the implemented Series Resistor is a class method requiring the attributes, self.series_model, self.short_model or self.reflect_model, self.thru_measurement, self.short_measurement, self.series_resistor_measurement. This method should be self.calculate_series_resistor_correction() \n",
    "\n",
    "It is usefull that \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_series_resistor_correction(thru_measurement,short_measurement,series_measurement,series_model,short_model=None):\n",
    "```\n",
    "is a stateless function that returns an eight term correction in [[frequency,S1_11,S1_21,S1_12,S1_22,S2_11,S2_21,S2_12,S2_22]..]\n",
    "form. \n",
    "\n",
    "This brings up the need for a TwoPortSparameterModel, or a class that can be passed a frequency list and return a S-parameter list. \n",
    "The TwoPortModel should have the following attributes:\n",
    "1. self.frequency a frequency list. the alias could be self.f, it should be setable like DataSimulator\n",
    "2. self.port_1_impedance and self.port_2_impedance\n",
    "3. self.function_list, a list of functions, FunctionalModels or DataSimulator objects that create a SParameter.\n",
    "4. The ability to represent itself in any form using TwoPortGraph, this brings up the need to set the port 1 and port 2 impedances in the graph. Not currently supported. \n",
    "5. The ability to output a latex form of the matrix in equations\n",
    "6. A serialized form that can be saved and opened -> this is a little harder.\n",
    "7. A string form that is [[f1,S11,S12,S21,S22]...[fN,S11,S12,S21,S22]] that can be passed to the SNP class for text form manipulations\n",
    "8. self.frequency_units, and the ability to change the frequency units. It should fix the equations to the frequency units\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other thoughts about functions. Functions that operate on objects should not change the state of the object, and should return a new object. Scripts and methods can change the state of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also this brings up the fundemental data model of a sparameter. Is it the sparameter_complex list? since this is immutable under all but frequency unit changes, it is also the data that is used in correct_sparameters.  "
