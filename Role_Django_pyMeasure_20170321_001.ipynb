    "Given any function $f$ such that $f(a,b,c) -> y$ the site's database denoted DB can have a table (Model found in models.py) with columns a,b,c. These values can be input by the user and then saved to be recalled at a later time.  Each model has a corresponding form (found in forms.py) that maps the input of the a,b,c to a html form. These forms return to the server a dictionary through the HTTPRequest (usually request) a dictionary of with element_name:element_value. Where any string is in unicode (u'string'). In return the server responds with a HTTPResponse or rendered template. These templates are passed a context data dictionary. Elements of this dictionary can be called in the template using the key of the dictionary {{key}}. \n",

    "Django is a FrontEnd, its data layer (DB) records input for recall at a latter date, and sets the current state of the FrontEnd. There are several built-in data models for site administration such as user and groups. In addition, any model can be added to the admin interface for direct editing by a superuser. \n",
