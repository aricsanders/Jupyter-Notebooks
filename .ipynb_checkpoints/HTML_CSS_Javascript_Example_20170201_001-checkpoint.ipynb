    "Much like the css commands that describe the formating and presentation specifics, scripts that execute when the page is loaded can be included in the `<head>` section of the html document. Also like css the syntax is different from html. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ For example, to load an external javascript program or library use the script tag, and use the src attribute to point to the \n",

    "<script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "+ You may also define your own program in javascript in the head element. This will be executed before the rest of the page loads, so it is common to see the `<script>` tag in both the head (before loading) and the body (after loading) to optimize load speed.\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<script>\n",
    "// My javascript function\n",
    "// ouput to the browser console\n",
    "console.log('My desired output: You find it by looking at inspect element, or f12 in the browser');\n",
    "// ouptut to a window that pops up\n",
    "alert('My desired output: just pops up in your face');\n",
    "</script>\n",
    "```\n",

    "+ The script tag is actually legal in any part of the html document, and javascript has a few wierd rules about moving function definitions and variable definitions around after executing them. This is known as Hoisting see for examples http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_hoisting.asp\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Javascript is a mix of syntaxes but resembles java in some ways. Its main purpose is to alter the html on the client side, as such its basic language components are centered around finding a tag, extracting content and putting it a changed version back in.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Since all browsers implement some subset of javascript or EMCAScript, there are an infinite number of libraries to make things easier. Two of the most important libraries are AJAX and JQUERY. AJAX is based on getting information from a server and updating a single piece of the html without reloading the entire page and JQUERY is about making the selection of tags easier and more consistent with the CSS syntax. Other javscript libraries that are popular are Bootstrap (about layout and buttons etc), React.js (some extra tools for making user interfaces), Angular (helps in web apps). These are all programmed in javascript and are typically executed in the head section by linking to the library through a cdn or serving the library file yourself.  "
